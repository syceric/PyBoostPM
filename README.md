# Unsupervised Tree Boosting

This is a Python/Cython implementation of the "boostPM" model presented in

Awaya, Naoki, and Li Ma. "Unsupervised tree boosting for learning probability distributions." Journal of Machine Learning Research 25.198 (2024): 1-52.

The package was originally written for use in R, and I decided to rewrite it to use in Python for my own research project. The original implementation can be found at https://github.com/MaStatLab/boostPM
